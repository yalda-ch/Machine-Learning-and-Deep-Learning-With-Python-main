# Project 1 — Linear and Polynomial Regression  

**Notebook:** `Yalda Chamani_Project1.ipynb`  
**Folder:** `project 1`  

---

## 📌 Project Description  
This project focuses on implementing **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models **from scratch** (without Scikit-learn). The goal is to build a deeper understanding of regression fundamentals, error measurement, and model comparison.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The project uses three datasets:  
- `Dataset_1_train.csv` — training set  
- `Dataset_1_valid.csv` — validation set  
- `Dataset_1_test.csv` — test set  

Each dataset contains two columns:  
- **Feature (X)**  
- **Target (Y)**  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 🚀 Workflow  
1. Load and preprocess the datasets (train, validation, test).  
2. Implement **Linear Regression** using closed-form formulas.  
3. Define a custom **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** function to evaluate performance.  
4. Extend the model to **Polynomial Regression** to capture nonlinear trends.  
5. Visualize predictions vs. actual data across all datasets.  

---

## 📈 Results  
- **Linear Regression** serves as a baseline but struggles with nonlinear data patterns.  
- **Polynomial Regression** provides a better fit by modeling curvature in the data.  
- **RMSE values** highlight improvements when moving from linear to polynomial models.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome  
- Build regression models **manually** without relying on libraries.  
- Understand the trade-offs between simple and complex models.  
- Gain hands-on experience in evaluating models using error metrics and plots.
